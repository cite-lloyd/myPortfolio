            <p>
              I’m starting this blog alongside the relaunch of my website development agency, Cite Digital, and the beginning of research and development for my first software product, TradeFocus. 
              <br>
              Cite Digital is a rebrand and relaunch of my previous agency Full Point, which slowed to a halt with me moving to London, starting a new job and moving in between areas to find somewhere to call home for the time being. 
              <br>
              TradeFocus is an investment portfolio analytics and management platform for traders and investors to manage all their accounts in one place and track detailed analytics and metrics to help them increase the rate of alpha they generate against the benchmarks. Development will be a slow process at first whilst managing the day job and Cite Digital but expect some news regarding a first beta release before the end of the year. 
              <br>
              <br>
              I guess it’s all good saying what I’m doing, but who am I and where did I come from? 
              <br>
              I grew up in a small village in the south of Nottingham, spent my teenage years at the skatepark, riding bmx bikes and skateboarding as well as studying software development at an entry level. My first real call to the entrepreneurial journey I later embarked on came during this period with a small clothing company sending me some clothes in return for some bmx photoshoots, I guess you could call it a sponsorship?. 
              <br>
              I did not go to university as most people had as I had found some success in the music industry at an early age, performing DJ shows around the country between 2017 - 2020, generating a small income alongside the job I had at the time. 
              <br>
              Then the world shut down… when everybody was cooped up inside during 2020 and 2021, I decided to learn a few instruments. Slowly picking up the piano, guitar, bass and drums. With no shows or bookings on the horizon and a new found set of skills, I started releasing music professionally on Spotify and popular DSPs. Fast forward to the winter of 2021 and I had a song catch on with playlist curators and editors, driving over 300,000 streams in the following six months. This is where things started to seem believable and over the next two years my music portfolio collected over 20,000,000 streams across all DSPs. 
              <br>
              Not everything was sunshine, however. I was laid off from the company I was working for at the time, a small web development agency in the city, as they went into administration and there weren't a great deal of opportunities for work in Nottingham at the time. This led me to living off the income generated from my music portfolio and therefore not able to collect and save to set up a brighter future from the outcome of the input over those few years. 
              <br>
              With the extra time I found on my hands and having the confidence achieved from doing something out of the ordinary with my music portfolio I decided to take matters into my own hands and start building websites as a freelancer to generate some extra income and work towards building something sustainable in the long-term. Then, during the spring of 2023, I decided to pack up shop and make the move to London in search of better opportunities.
              <br>
              <br>
              Now, I’m living in London, I’ve found a place to call home and have a job I somewhat enjoy. I am relighting the fire for solo web development. I still write and record music but I find it more fulfilling to write for myself and not for the briefs and expectations of record labels. 
              I probably won’t update this blog all that often but I would love to chat with you so get in touch!
